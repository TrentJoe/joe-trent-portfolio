      <h1>Joseph Trent CV</h1>
      <p>
        BSc Computer Science undergraduate at Bournemouth University and former Great Britain semi-professional athlete, seeking a 2025–26 industrial placement. After spending three years living and competing abroad at elite international level, I have transitioned the same discipline, resilience, and high-pressure decision-making into a career in technology. I have a strong technical foundation in full-stack development (React, Express, Python) and experience working in fast-paced, operational environments requiring accuracy, communication, and problem-solving. Highly motivated, excited to learn, and eager to gain hands-on experience across software engineering, systems, data, or cloud-focused roles.
