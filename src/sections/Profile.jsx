      <h1>Joseph Trent CV</h1>
      <p>
        I am a BSc Computer Science student at Bournemouth University and former Great Britain semi-professional athlete. Having spent three years living abroad to compete at the highest level, I have now successfully transitioned that same elite-level discipline and drive into a new passion for technology. I combine high pressure decision making with a strong technical foundation in Full-Stack Development (React, Express, Python). I am fully committed to my career in technology and am seeking an industrial placement to apply my high performance mindset and learn from experienced professionals. I am eager to gain experience in any technical role like software development, data science, DevOps, cloud computing and many more.
